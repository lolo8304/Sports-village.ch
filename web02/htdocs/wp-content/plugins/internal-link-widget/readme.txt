Enable a new widget to easily manage internal link to pages.

== Description ==
Tired of hardcoding the internal link to pages of your website and having to manually change them when needed or when the site domain changes? Or maybe tired of setting up a specific menu just to have it available as widget? This is the plugin for you.

With a *simple interface* you can add internal links wherever you want and they'll continue to work if the slug (internal link url) or the site domain will change.

And it's very easy to customize, just a few lines of CSS and you are ready to go.

The widget allows you to:

1. Define a title
2. Show/hide the title
3. Choose a custom text for the link
4. Select the internal page to link to

In the last years I found myself doing this over and over again so I did this plugin to speed up some work and to keep the customization freedom I'm used to.
